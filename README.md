Deployment
----------
Please refer to the installation instructions in the [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) file, or check out the [Movim Wiki](https://github.com/movim/movim/wiki) for more information.

Quick Test
----------

You can try out Movim on your local machine in a container using [Podman (main website)](https://podman.io/). Podman is a FOSS alternative to Docker that is available on all the main distributions.

⚠️ __This setup is only for tests purpose, the containers are not optimized and most of the caches are disabled. To deploy your own Movim instance use the [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) tutorial.__

Install `podman-compose` and clone the repository before trying the next steps.

Launch the podman-compose script

    podman-compose up

After a few minutes it will launch a local test instance with a blank database.

You can then access in your browser at the following URL:

    https://127.0.0.1:8443/

The container is using a self-signed certificate, accept to get to the login page.

Security report
