Movim Deployment
===================

This tutorial describes the different steps you need to take to deploy Movim on your webserver.

# Get-Started

Movim requires some dependencies to be setup properly.
  * A fully working webserver like Apache, nginx or Caddy
  * A PHP process manager like php-fpm will usually be required for Nginx
  * Root access by SSH with access to the webserver user (most of the time via the user www-data)
  * A SQL server with a schema for Movim.
     * PostgreSQL (**_strongly recommended_** some features are only available on this database)
     * MariaDB 10.2 or higher with utf8mb4 encoding (necessary for emojis ðŸ˜ƒ support) AND `utf8mb4_bin` collation.
     * MySQL is __NOT__ supported and will throw errors during the migrations, please use PostgreSQL or MariaDB.
  * **PHP 8.2 minimum** with :
     * Curl (package ''**php-curl**'')
     * PHP mbstring (package ''**php-mbstring**'')
     * PHP ImageMagick and GD for the picture processing (package ''**php-imagick**'' and ''**php-gd**'')
     * Your database PHP driver (package ''**php-pgsql**'' or ''**php-mysql**'' depending on the type of database server you want to use).
     * And the PHP XML (package ''**php-xml**'')
     * Also the PHP Zip (package ''**php-zip**'') to import Emojis

### Debian/Ubuntu

    apt install composer php-fpm php-curl php-mbstring php-imagick php-gd php-pgsql php-xml php-zip

# General architecture

It's mandatory to understand the general architecture of the project to a certain extent before trying to deploy it.

When you use Movim, it acts as an intermediary between the user's browser and an XMPP server. All the data that is sent and received by these two parties are managed by the Movim core, some of them are also saved in a database (for cache purposes).

From the browser perspective, all communication with Movim is done using WebSockets (except for the "default" page loading). These sockets are proxied through your web-server to the Movim daemon. On the XMPP side Movim connects using pure TCP connections (like any XMPP client).

So all these streams will be managed by the Movim daemon. This daemon needs to be launched with the same user and rights as the web-server (most of the time using the ``www-data`` user).

# Installation

## Stable version

### Releases

You can simply follow the GIT tags or download a stable snapshot of this repository on our [Release page](https://github.com/movim/movim/releases). Then follow the steps from [Dependency installation](https://github.com/movim/movim/wiki/Install-Movim#dependency-installation).

## Development version (repository)

The development version of Movim only comes with the core of the project. To install the dependencies you need to install Git to download the source codes from different repositories.
```bash
# Install Git so that Composer
# can clone the dependencies into your project
apt-get install git
```
### Downloading

Git is required to properly get the source code from the official repository. We recommend to execute the following commands with the `www-data` user (which is the common user for most of the GNU/Linux web servers).
```bash
cd /var/www/ # Server directory
mkdir movim
chown www-data:www-data movim
sudo -s -u www-data # We use the web-server user
# We copy the source code from the repository
git clone https://github.com/movim/movim.git
```
### Dependency installation

Movim requires several dependencies to work properly. These libraries are managed using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/).

#### If you already have composer

    cd movim
    composer install

#### If you have to install manually composer

You can install Composer in the Movim directory using the following command or by using your package manager:
```bash
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
```
Now you will be able to install the dependencies.
```bash
# Finally install your project's dependencies
php composer.phar install
```
### Update

You can also update your current Movim instance with the following lines (check anyway if the updates do not include any incompatibilities with your current version).
```bash
cd /var/www/movim/
git pull # To update the Movim source-code
composer install # To update the libraries
```
If the update comes with some database changes you can run the new migrations (see below).

# Deployment

This part of the tutorial can be followed for the stable and testing installation. They need to be applied **in the correct order**.

## 1. Rights check

Movim needs reading permissions on its root folder and recursively to be deployed properly. It will also try to create two folders:

  * **log/** for the PHP logs
  * **cache/** for the internal cache (templates and other system files)
  * **public/cache/** for the public caches (pictures, CSS, Javascriptâ€¦)

You can create the folders in advance and it will skip this step, or you can let it by giving it writing permissions on its root folder:
```bash
# Use the root user to do the command
mkdir cache
chown www-data movim && chown www-data movim/public && chown www-data movim/cache && chmod u+rwx movim
```

You might have to replace the `www-data` user with the `apache` or `caddy` user in the last command regarding your OS or the web-server you have.

## 2. DotEnv configuration

Movim relies on [DotEnv](https://github.com/vlucas/phpdotenv) for its configuration.

To configure Movim copy the `.env.example` file in a new `.env` one and fill the different settings in it.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
nano .env
```

You can also set those settings using directly [environment variables like with Docker](https://docs.docker.com/compose/environment-variables/).

## 3. Database setup

Once the database is setup in the `.env` file create or update the database structure using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/).
```bash
composer movim:migrate
```

## 4. Start the daemon

To let the browser communicate with the Movim server, you need to launch the daemon. It also needs to be launched using the web server user.
```bash
sudo -s -u www-data # If you are on Ubuntu
```
Then start the daemon using the parameters configured in the `.env` file.

```bash
cd /var/www/movim
php daemon.php start # Launch the daemon
```

If everything runs as expected you should see:

    Movim daemon launched
    Base URL : {public url of your pod}
    â€¦

This daemon will be killed once your console is closed. Consider using `systemd` or `init` scripts to keep the daemon running in the foreground even after your disconnection. There are example startup files, like a `systemd` service file, in the [`etc/` directory](https://github.com/movim/movim/tree/master/etc).

## 5. Web Server configuration

### 5.1. Virtualhost

Create a virtualhost on your preferred webserver and point the root to the `public/index.php` file. You can have a look at the [default configuration files that we provide](https://github.com/movim/movim/tree/master/etc) if you need some help about that part.

Movim is developped to work at the root of a domain or subdomain. __Don't try to deploy it as a subdirectory__ or you might face some unexpected issues.

### 5.2. Daemon Websocket proxy

When you launch the daemon, **it will generate the configuration** to apply to the Virtualhost file to "proxify" the WebSockets and display it in the console.

These configurations are dynamically generated to fit your current setup. Whether you use Apache, Caddy or nginx, both possible configuration will be displayed and will display even after you successfully applied them.

### 5.3. Picture proxy cache

Movim is automatically proxyfying the external pictures to protect its user IPs and prevent large pictures to be loaded without user consent.
This internal proxy is already asking the browser to cache the pictures for a few hours.

It is however **strongly recommended** to also setup a server side cache to prevent multiple users to request the same resource through Movim.

#### On Apache

You will need Apache mods `cache_disk`, `expires`, and `headers`. You can enable them with the a2enmod command. Example: `a2enmod cache_disk`

Then add this section to your Movim VirtualHost

```
CacheQuickHandler on
CacheLock on
CacheLockPath /tmp/mod_cache-lock
CacheLockMaxAge 5
CacheIgnoreHeaders Set-Cookie
<Location /picture>
	CacheEnable disk
	CacheHeader on
	CacheDefaultExpire 6000
	CacheMaxExpire 3600
	CacheIgnoreNoLastMod On
	ExpiresActive on
	ExpiresDefault A3600
	Header set Cache-Control public
	Header merge Cache-Control max-age=604800
	FileETag All
</Location>
```

Afterwards, reload Apache.

#### On nginx

To do so you can configure ```fastcgi_cache``` on nginx, [check the related documentation](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_fastcgi_module.html#fastcgi_cache).

Add this to your `nginx.conf` in the `http` section:

    http {
        â€¦
        fastcgi_cache_path /tmp/nginx_cache levels=1:2 keys_zone=nginx_cache:100m inactive=60m;
        fastcgi_cache_key "$scheme$request_method$host$request_uri";
    }

And check the related documentation in our nginx example file [movim.conf](https://github.com/movim/movim/blob/master/etc/nginx/conf.d/movim.conf).

#### On Caddy

For caddy you may want to take a look at xcaddy and compiling the server with the following modules: [cache-handler](https://github.com/caddyserver/cache-handler), [cdp-cache](https://github.com/sillygod/cdp-cache)

## 6. Admin panel

The admin panel is available directly from the Movim UI once an admin user is logged in.

To set a user admin login at least once (to register it in the database). You can then set him admin using the following command.

    php daemon.php setAdmin {jid}

The administrators will be listed on the login page of the instance.

Some of the configuration elements are only applied after the reboot of the daemon.
