version 2.1.2
-------------
- Merged Movim 0.1 patched Jaxl lib into 'master' 
- Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/oldschoolindustries/JAXL into oldschoolindustries-master 
- Improved httpd class and related changed in core jaxl class. Also fixed a few typos inside core classes 
- Added option to pass getSXE option to Jaxl constructor (Whether Jaxl core should return a SimpleXMLElement object of parsed string with callback payloads)
- Better handling for multi-instance jaxl applications (Use JAXL::addCore to add new instance)
  Simple method of issuing unique id to each connected jaxl instance
  Improved dumpStat cron to include send/rcv rate, buffer sizes in stats
  Core logged class prefix log data with instance uid, pid and current clock
  Parse class return false if unable to parse as xml for recv'd xmpp packet
  Lots of core improvement in XMPP base class related to performance and multi-instance app handling
- Updated core class files to make use of JAXL::executePlugin method instead of JAXLPlugin::execute method
- XMPP base class now make use of socket_select() to poll opened stream efficiently (getting rid of annoying sleep)
  Updated JAXLCron method to adjust to new core changes
- Added hook for jaxl_get_bosh_curl_error which is called when bosh end point returns a non-zero errno
  Updated Jaxl core session variable names to avoid clash with existing session vars
  Updated boshchat.php to make use of jaxl_get_bosh_curl_error to disconnect intelligently
- PHP CMS looking to integrate Jaxl in their core can now force disable auto start of php session by Jaxl core
  Simple pass 'boshSession' as false with jaxl constructor config array
- Entire Jaxl core including xmpp/, xep/ and core/ class files now make use of JAXL::addPlugin instead of JAXLPlugin to register per instance callbacks
- JAXLPlugin can now register a callback for a dedicated jaxl instance in a multi-instance jaxl application
  Class functionality remains backward compatible.
- JAXLog class now also dump connect instance uid per log line
- XMPP instance iq id now defaults to a random value between 1 and 9
  Also added jaxl_get_id event hook for apps to customize iq id for the connected Jaxl instance
  Also as compared to default numeric iq id, Jaxl core now uses hex iq id's
- Every jaxl instance per php process id now generate it's own unique id JAXL::$uid
- Jaxl core doesn't go for a session if it's optional as indicated by the xmpp server

  Upgraded Jaxl Parser class which was malfunctioning on CentOS PHP 5.1.6 (cli)
- Added bosh error response handling and appropriate logging inside XMPP over Bosh core files
- Code cleanup inside jaxl logger class. 
  Fixed getConfigByPriority method which was malfunctioning in specific cases
- JAXLog class now using inbuild php function (error_log)
- Checking in first version of XEP-0016 (Privacy Lists), XEP-0055 (Jabber Search), XEP-0077 (In-Band Registration), XEP-0144 (Roster Item Exchange), XEP-0153 (vCard-Based Avatars), XEP-0237 (Roster Versioning)
- On auth faliure core doesn't throw exception since XMPP over Bosh apps are not held inside a try catch block (a better fix may be possible in future)
- XMPP over BOSH xep wasn't passing back Jaxl instance obj for jaxl_post_disconnect hook, fixed that for clean disconnect
- Jaxl core attempts to create log and pid files if doesn't already exists
  Also instead of die() core throws relevant exception message wherever required
  XMPP base classes throws relevant exception with message wherever required
- First commit of JAXLException class. JAXL core now uses JAXLException
- Jaxl constructor dies if logPath, pidPath and tmpPath doesn't exists on the system

- Added provision for local roster cache management inside Jaxl core.
  Retrived roster lists are cached in memory (see updated echobot.php sample example).
  Also added provision for presence tracking (JAXL::trackPresence).
  If enabled Jaxl core keep a track of jid availability and update local roster cache accordingly.
  Also added provision for auto-accept subscription (JAXL::autoSubscribe).
- Removed XMPP::isConnected variable which used to tell status of connected socket stream.
  This is equivalent to checking XMPP:stream variable for true/false

- Added JAXL_PING_INTERVAL configuration option inside jaxl.ini
- XEP-0199 (XMPP Ping) can now automatically ping the connected server periodically for keeping connection alive on long running bots
  (see echobot.php sample app for usage)
- Updated JAXLCron::add method to accept a number of arguments while adding bckgrnd jobs
  These list of arguments is passed back to the application method

- Jaxl now shutdown gracefully is encryption is required and openssl PHP module is not loaded in the environment
- For every registered callback on XMPP hooks, callback'd method will receive two params.
  A payload and reference of Jaxl instance for whom XMPP event has occured.
  Updated sample application code to use passed back Jaxl instance reference instead of global jaxl variable.
- As a library convention XEP's exposing user space configuration parameters via JAXL constructor SHOULD utilize JAXL::getConfigByPriority method
  Added JAXL_TMP_PATH option inside jaxl.ini
- Jaxl::tmp is now Jaxl::tmpPath. Also added Jaxl config param to specify custom tmp path location
  Jaxl client also self detect the IP of the host it is running upon (to be used by STUN/TURN utilities in Jingle negotitation)

- Removing env/jaxl.php and env/jaxl.conf (were required if you run your apps using `jaxl` command line utility)
  Updated env/jaxl.ini so that projects can now directly include their app setting via jaxl.ini (before including core/jaxl.class.php)
- Added JAXL::bareJid public variable for usage inside applications.
  XMPP base class now return bool on socket connect completion (used by PHPUnit test cases)
- Removing build.sh file from library for next release
  Users should simply download, extract, include and write their app code without caring about the build script from 2.1.2 release
- As a library convention to include XEP's use JAXL::requires() method, while to include any core/ or xmpp/ base class use jaxl_require() method.
  Updated library code and xep's to adhere to this convention.
  Jaxl instance now provide a system specific /tmp folder location accessible by JAXL::tmp

  if an auth mech is pre-chosen app files SHOULD not register callback for jaxl_get_auth_mech hook.
  Bosh cookie settings can now be passed along with Jaxl constructor.
  Added support for publishing vcard-temp:x:update node along with presence stanzas.
  Jaxl instance can run in 3 modes a.k.a. stream,component and bosh mode
  applications should use JAXL::startCore('mode') to configure instance for a specific mode.
